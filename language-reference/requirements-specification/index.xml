We assume the existence of a timed transition system (S, s0, →) as defined in the semantics of UPPAAL timed automata. In the following, p and q are state properties for which we define the following temporal properties:
Possibly The property E&amp;lt;&amp;gt; p evaluates to true for a timed transition system if and only if there is a sequence of delay and action transitions s0 → s1 → &amp;hellip; → sn, where s0 is the initial state and sn satisfies p.</description></item><item><title>Semantics of the Statistical Queries</title><link>/language-reference/requirements-specification/smc_queries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/language-reference/requirements-specification/smc_queries/</guid><description>UPPAAL can estimate the probability of expression values statistically. There are four types of statistical properties: quantitative, qualitative, comparison and probable value estimation.

The simulation runs can be filtered by a state expression after the colon (&amp;rsquo;:&amp;rsquo;) and the number of satisfying runs can be limited by positive integer using SMCBounds and SATRUNS.</description></item><item><title>CI Estimation</title><link>/language-reference/requirements-specification/ci_estimation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/language-reference/requirements-specification/ci_estimation/</guid><description>Probability estimation query Pr[&amp;hellip;](&amp;lt;&amp;gt; q) yields a confidence interval (CI) for the probability of the state expression q being true with the confidence level of 1-α. For example, it could be [0.45, 0.55] (95% CI), or could be written as 0.5 ± 0.05 (95% CI), where ε=0.05 and α=0.05.
The frequentist interpretation of CI is that there exists a true probability that the state expression q is true and it is included in that confidence interval, but there is a risk α of making an error (the true probability being outside the confidence interval).</description></item></channel></rss>
