A verification is always performed according to the settings specified in the Options menu of the main menu bar.
The selected queries are verified when the button named Check is pressed. The verification progress dialog displays the progress of how many queries have been verified, what is the current load of a passed-waiting list, current processor time usage (the time spent for verification is in blue, the time spent by operating system is in red), current usage of host&amp;rsquo;s random access memory (verification memory is in blue, memory used by other running processes is in gray and operating system cache and buffers are in yellow), swap disk usage (swapped out verification is in blue, other is in grey).</description></item></channel></rss>
