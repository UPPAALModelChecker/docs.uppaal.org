It is used to control the simulation and to select the state or transition to be visualized in the others panels of the simulator. The control panel is divided in two parts:
The upper part is used for performing step-by-step simulation. The Transition chooser area is a clickable area where vertical axis displays the active transitions at this location and horizontal axis displays the time at which the transition will be Ô¨Åred.</description></item><item><title>Variables Panel</title><link>/gui-reference/concrete-simulator/variables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gui-reference/concrete-simulator/variables/</guid><description>The variables panel is the middle panel of the simulator. It displays the values of the data and clock variables in the current state or transition selected in the trace of the simulation control panel.</description></item><item><title>Process Panel</title><link>/gui-reference/concrete-simulator/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gui-reference/concrete-simulator/process/</guid><description>The process panel is the rightmost upper panel of the simulator. It displays the process instances of the system descriptions. A red token marks the current control point of each automaton. One or more of the automata edges may also be red to indicate the transition currently selected in the simulation control panel.
Clicking inside a process box with the right mouse button opens a pop-up menu with the following items:</description></item><item><title>Message Sequence Chart</title><link>/gui-reference/concrete-simulator/sequence-chart/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gui-reference/concrete-simulator/sequence-chart/</guid><description>The Message Sequence Chart (MSC) panel is the lower rightmost panel of the simulator. It displays an MSC view of the generated trace (also displayed in the simulation control panel of the simulator).
In the MSC view there is a vertical line for each process, and a horizontal line for each synchronisation point. The process name of each vertical line is indicated in the upper part of the MSC panel. The node names shown on the vertical lines indicate the control location of the automaton.</description></item><item><title>Gantt Chart Panel</title><link>/gui-reference/concrete-simulator/gantt-chart/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gui-reference/concrete-simulator/gantt-chart/</guid><description>The Gantt Chart panel is the middle rightmost panel of the simulator. It displays another view of the generated trace according to the Gantt Chart specification given in system definition.
In the Gantt Chart view, the horizontal axis represents the time span, and in the vertical axis the list of activities (usually some of the system processes) defined in the Gantt chart specification are listed. A vertical line is used to represent the current time (which corresponds to the one displayed in the Simulation Trace-combo box).</description></item></channel></rss>
